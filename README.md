# ML--Project---Room--Occupancy--Estimation

Project Overview: 
This data-driven project explores how environmental sensor readings—such as temperature, light, sound, and motion—correlate with room occupancy patterns across different times of the day. Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, we perform comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis, including:

Handling missing data and duplicates

Aggregating and visualizing time-based occupancy trends

Binning records into custom time-of-day segments

Analyzing sensor interactions using scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps

Investigating occupancy distributions through bar and pie charts

Preparing the dataset for machine learning with label encoding and feature reduction

These steps lay the foundation for building smart, sensor-based occupancy prediction models for intelligent spaces.
